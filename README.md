Python SkunkWorks

> This is a repo contains all the iPython notebooks which were created while I was learning various stuff in nlp using nltk, scikit, etc.

### Note: local running of notebooks requires the installation of individual components (like nltk, scikit, numpy, etc.) or you can directly install anaconda and nltk.
